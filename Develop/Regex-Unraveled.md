## Regex Components

Regex components refer to the fundamental building blocks used to construct regular expressions. Each component serves a specific purpose in defining the search pattern. Common regex components include:

- **Literals:** Characters or sequences of characters that match themselves exactly. For example, the literal a matches the character "a" in the text such a /hello/.

- **Metacharacters:** Special characters with predefined meanings and are used to build patters for matching text in regex. 

  - **Examples include:** ^(match is at the beginign od the line), $(match is a at the end of the line), .(match is any single character excepf for new line characters ('\n')), * (matches zero or more occurences of the preceding character), +(matches one or more occurrence of the presceding character), ? (matches zero or more occurences), \ (escapes the next character, allowing you to match literal metacharacters), | (pipe acts as an OR operator allowing you to specifyly multiple alternatives), () (parenthese creates a pacture  group for extracton match substrings or appplying wuintifyiers), [] (scuqare brackets matchess any single characters withing the brackers), {} (are used depending depending on the context), etc.

- **Character Classes:** Sets of characters enclosed in square brackets [ ] are a way to specify a group of character that you want to match in a regular expression. For example, [aeiou] matches any vowel.

- **Quantifiers:** In regular expression are symbols used to specify the quantity or repetions of characters or groups in a pattern. Examples include *(matches zero), +(matches one or more times), ?(matches zerotimes), {}(specifies the exact range of ocurrences), etc.

- **Anchors:** In regular expressions, anchors are special characters used to specify the posituon of a match within the text. Examples include ^ for the beginning of a line and $ for the end of a line. Other items can be \b (boundary anchor mathes a postition where a word matches), \B (non-word boundary matches a positio where a word is followed or preceeded by another word character), \A (begining of the entire inpit string), \Z (specfied the end of the entire input string but doe not match before a new line) and \z (matches only at the end of the end and not before any final line terminator).

- **Groups and Capturing:** In regular expressions, groups and capturing are used to specify and capture sub-patterns within a larger pattern. Groups allow you to treat multiple characters as a single unit and apply quantifiers, alternations, and other operations to that unit as a whole. Parentheses () are used to create groups that treat multiple characters as a single unit. Capturing groups also capture the text matched by the regex inside them for later use.
Alternation: The OR operator | used to specify alternatives within a pattern. It matches either the expression before or after it.

- **Escape Sequences:** Sequences of characters preceded by a backslash \ that represent special characters or character classes. For example, \d matches any digit character.

- **Modifiers or Flags:** Additional parameters that can be added to a regex pattern to change its behavior. Examples include i for case-insensitive matching and g for global matching.

### Anchors

Anchors play a crucial role in regex by pinpointing positions within text where matches should occur. Unlike regular characters, they don't represent actual characters but rather positions in the string. The most common anchors are ^ (caret), signifying the start of a line, and $ (dollar sign), indicating the end of a line. Anchors are vital for enforcing specific patterns at the beginning or end of a string.

**Examples:**

 - ^: Matches the beginning of a line.
 - $: Matches the end of a line.

**Regex:** ^Hello

**Description:** This regex precisely targets the word "Hello", but only if it's positioned at the beginning of a line.


### Quantifiers

Quantifiers are essential components of regular expressions that determine the quantity or repetition of characters or groups in a pattern. They provide control over how many times a character or group can appear in a match, enabling the crafting of flexible and precise search patterns.

**Examples:** 

- *: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.

- +: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element.

- ?: Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding element.

- {n}: Matches exactly n occurrences of the preceding element.

- {n,}: Matches at least n occurrences of the preceding element.

- {n,m}: Matches between n and m occurrences of the preceding element.

**Regex:** a+

**Description:** This regular expression matches one or more occurrences of the letter "a" in the text. For instance, it would match "a", "aa", "aaa", and so forth.

### OR Operator

The OR operator in regex, represented by the vertical bar |, allows you to specify alternatives within a pattern. It matches either the expression before or after it. For example, cat|dog would match either "cat" or "dog". The OR operator is useful for creating patterns that can match multiple variations of a particular substring.

**Example:** 
- |: Matches either the expression before or after it.

**Regex:** cat|dog

**Description:** This regular expression successfully matches either "cat" or "dog" within the text

### Character Classes

Character classes in regular expressions offer a means to define a set of characters that can match at a specific position within the pattern. These classes are encapsulated within square brackets [ ]. For instance, [aeiou] matches any vowel, while [0-9] matches any digit. Employing character classes facilitates the creation of patterns capable of matching different characters at a designated position.

**Example:** 
- [aeiou]: Matches any vowel character.
- [0-9]: Matches any digit character.
- [a-zA-Z]: Matches any alphabetical character (both lowercase and uppercase).

**Regex:** [aeiou]

**Description:** This regular expression successfully matches any vowel character within the text.

### Flags


Flags, also referred to as modifiers, are extra parameters that can be appended to a regex pattern, altering its behavior. They influence how the regex engine interprets the pattern. Commonly used flags include:

- i: Enables case-insensitive matching.
- g: Activates global matching, which finds all matches rather than stopping after the first one.
- m: Switches to multiline mode, adjusting the behavior of ^ and $ to match the beginning and end of lines instead of the entire string

**Example:** 
- i: Case-insensitive matching.
- g: Global matching (finding all matches rather than stopping after the first one).
- m: Multiline mode (changing the behavior of ^ and $ to match the beginning and end of lines instead of the entire string).

**Regex:** /hello/i

**Description:** This regex effectively matches "hello" case-insensitively within the text.


### Grouping and Capturing

Grouping in regular expressions enables the consolidation of multiple characters into a unified entity. Parentheses () serve as delimiters for creating groups. Capturing groups not only group the regex but also retain the text matched by the regex within them for future reference. Proficiency in understanding grouping and capturing is pivotal for isolating specific segments of a match or implementing alterations to matched text.

**Example:** 
- (): Creates a capturing group.

**Regex:** (\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4})

**Description:** This regular expression captures a phone number in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions, often referred to as character classes or character sets, are patterns that match any single character enclosed within square brackets [ ]. They offer a succinct means to define a set of characters that can match at a specific position within the pattern. Bracket expressions provide versatility in crafting patterns capable of matching various characters or character ranges.

**Example:** 
- [abc]: Matches any of the characters inside the brackets.
- [^abc]: Matches any character except those inside the brackets.

**Regex:** [abc]

**Description:** This regular expression successfully matches any of the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c' within the text.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

Greedy and lazy quantifiers are essential elements in regex that dictate how quantified expressions behave. Greedy quantifiers aim to match as much text as possible, while lazy quantifiers seek to match as little text as possible. Greedy quantifiers are represented by *, +, and ?, whereas lazy quantifiers are denoted by adding a ? after the quantifier. Understanding the distinction between greedy and lazy quantifiers is pivotal for refining regex patterns and preventing unintended matches.

**Example:** 
- * (greedy): Matches as much text as possible.
- *? (lazy): Matches as little text as possible.

 - Text: `<p>Hello</p><p>World</p>`


**Regex:**  &lt;p&gt;.*&lt;/p&gt;

**Description:** This greedy regex matches &lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World&lt;/p&gt; in the text.</span>


### Boundaries


Boundaries in regular expressions establish positions in the text where specific conditions are fulfilled. Commonly utilized boundaries encompass \b for word boundaries and \B for non-word boundaries. Word boundaries identify positions where a word character \w is not preceded or followed by another word character, whereas non-word boundaries identify positions where two word characters or two non-word characters are adjacent. Employing boundaries aids in articulating precise search criteria.

**Examples:** 

- \b: Matches a word boundary.
- \B: Matches a non-word boundary.

**Regex:** \bcat\b

**Description:** This regular expression successfully matches the word "cat" as an entire word in the text.

### Back-references

Back-references within regular expressions enable the reuse of text previously matched by a capturing group. They point back to the contents of capturing groups within the same regex pattern. Represented by \1, \2, and so forth, where the number corresponds to the index of the capturing group, leveraging back-references empowers advanced pattern matching and substitution techniques.

**Examples:** 
- \1, \2, etc.: Refers back to the contents of capturing groups.

**Regex:** (\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4}) \1-\2-\3

**Description:** This regular expression matches a phone number followed by the same phone number again (e.g., 123-456-7890 123-456-7890).

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Look-ahead and look-behind assertions in regular expressions provide a means to verify whether a specific pattern is or is not followed by or preceded by another pattern, without incorporating the matched text into the overall match result. Positive look-ahead assertions are represented by (?=...), while positive look-behind assertions are denoted by (?<=...), and negative assertions by (?!...) for look-ahead and (?<!...) for look-behind. Proficiency in utilizing look-ahead and look-behind assertions enhances the capabilities of regex for addressing more intricate matching criteria.

**Example:**

- (?=...): Positive look-ahead assertion.
- (?<=...): Positive look-behind assertion.
- (?!...): Negative look-ahead assertion.
- (?<!...): Negative look-behind assertion.

**Regex:** (?<=\d{3}-)\d{3}-\d{4}

**Description:** This regular expression matches a phone number that is preceded by another phone number in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX
